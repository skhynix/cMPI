# cxl\_type3\_tests
This repository contains two parts:
1. **memo** -- a versatile benchmark for CXL-related memory behaviors and characterizations.
2. **caption** -- a performance tuning (based on memory page allocation) tool to maximize the system memory bandwidth utilazation in a CXL-enabled system.

They are the correpsonding artifacts of the paper `Demystifying CXL Memory with True CXL-Ready Systems and CXL Memory Devices (MICRO'23)`, the first research work of CXL memory characterization based on real CXL hardware devices. 

For the artifact evaluation configurations, please refer to [link to config repo](https://github.com/ece-fast-lab/cxl_type3_tests_ae)
